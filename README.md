# PHP_Bookstore
This is a project for a module at Northumbria University Computer Science course. The website is a simple bookstore, with authentication and authorisation. It allows administrators to manage the books and users to "buy" books in the store. The website uses PHP sessions to manage user's login and MySQL database for storing data.
