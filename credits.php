        <h4>External libraries for styling</h4>
        <p>
            Please, note that I have been using this library for more than 3 years
            and have prior experience with developing webpages. I hope my code does not look
            copied from somewhere as I may have used some prior knowledge from school and programming courses that I took.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope this is not academic misconduct, as I asked the tutors about it, and I got
            an affirmative response to use it as the styling is not marked.
            I chose this library over writing my own css, because I already know it and it is easier to make the site look pretty.
